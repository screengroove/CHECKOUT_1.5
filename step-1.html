YOUR INVESTMENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</h5><p> You acknowledge that investing in precious metals involves risks and may not be suitable for everyone. You are therefore urged to consult with your own financial advisor(s) before making a decision. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Investing in precious metal(s) often involves a degree of risk that makes them unsuitable for certain individuals.

GoldSilver makes no recommendations, projections, representations, or guarantees with respect to future prices, or performance of precious metals. Precious metals are not FDIC insured and may lose value. You acknowledge that you are subject to a variety of risks, which risks are beyond the control of GoldSilver, and you also acknowledge that GoldSilver is not liable or responsible for those risks. Those risks include, without limitation, risks associated with the price volatility of the products, particularly precious metals. Under certain market or other conditions (such as technological or other disruptions), you may not be able to liquidate the purchased products or, liquidate the purchased products at prices acceptable to you.</p><h5> 4.	ABSENCE OF RELATIONSHIP</h5><p> You represent and warrant to GoldSilver that you have sufficient experience and knowledge to make informed decisions to purchase from or sell precious metals to GoldSilver. You acknowledge that you are making all of your own decisions in connection with purchases or sales and that you have not relied on any information made available by GoldSilver, including without limitation GoldSilver.com™ or affiliate websites, and that GoldSilver is not making any recommendation with respect to such purchases or sales. You further acknowledge that there is no fiduciary duty between you and GoldSilver. The sole relationship between you and GoldSilver is purchaser-seller relationship. No other relationship, including, without limitation, any agent-principal relationship, any advisor-advisee relationship, any employee-employer relationship, any franchisee-franchisor relationship, any joint venture relationship or any partnership relationship, exists between you and GoldSilver.</p><h5> 5.	PURCHASING AND SELLING PRECIOUS METALS</h5><p><strong> A.</strong>	Purchasing from GoldSilver. You may purchase precious metals from GoldSilver as an individual, LLC, Corporation, Trust or through your IRA account using U.S. dollars. All individual purchases are transacted via Goldsilver.com™, by telephone or e-mail. You acknowledge that prices for precious metals change throughout the day and that the prices charged by GoldSilver reflect live market prices and therefore all sales are final and cannot be canceled, refunded or returned. Payment in full for orders must be sent within one (1) business day (Monday through Friday, Pacific Time Zone, USA) from the date your purchase is confirmed (the "Order Date"). Payments sent by wire transfer must be sent by the end of the next business day and before the close of your bank's wire transfer cutoff time for that day. The latest a bank wire transfer can be executed for the same day is 5:00 PM EST, however it is your responsibility to know the hours during which your bank performs wire transfers. If your payment is not received within five (5) business days of the Order Date, GoldSilver may implement its Market Loss Policy (as defined below) and shall have the right to apply your initial payment against the amount owed to us. Furthermore, you agree that we may charge your credit or debit card and/ or receive compensation for losses resulting from a defaulted IRA order pursuant to our Market Loss Policy. GoldSilver provides a 2 way market in which you, at your sole discretion, may choose to sell approved gold and/ or silver back to us at our currently offered rates as detailed in Sell Gold & Silver and GoldSilver.com™ Sellback Policy. <hr><strong>B.</strong>	Selling to GoldSilver. You acknowledge that GoldSilver's sellback policy is entirely voluntary and non-exclusive. This means that you may elect to sell product purchased from us to any interested party, including at your sole discretion, back to GoldSilver in accordance with the GoldSilver.com™ Sellback Policy. All sales to GoldSilver are transacted via your account with Goldsilver.com™, by telephone or e-mail. All sales are final and cannot be canceled. A sale is final and the agreement shall be binding when the price and type of precious metal(s) have been locked-in by GoldSilver. In the event you breach the agreement, GoldSilver may implement its Market Loss Policy pursuant to this agreement. The items eligible for sale to us must be a product of like-kind that we carry, in new condition and in increments that we sell at Goldsilver.com™. We reserve the right to charge an assay fee to verify the purity and authenticity of the product that may be charged against the final sellback price. When selling to GoldSilver, we will provide you with a "Sellback Contract" which will include any fees that may be associated with selling back and must be completed, with the product shipped, within one (1) business day of the contract's formation. GoldSilver will provide payment by check or bank wire transfer; bank wire transfers are subject to a one-time transactional fee pursuant to our current policy. The full terms of the agreement are located on the Sell Gold & Silver and GoldSilver.com™ Sellback Policy, which is incorporated here by this reference. We reserve the right to terminate this policy at any time without notice.<hr><strong>C.</strong>	Electronic Order Risks. Order entry systems have been designed to provide an efficient and dependable method for entering orders. Commercial internet service providers are not 100% reliable and a failure by one or more of these providers may affect internet-based order entry. You acknowledge that the order entry system is an electronic mechanical system and as such may be subject to failure beyond the control of GoldSilver. Therefore, GoldSilver shall not be responsible for errors, negligence, inability to execute orders, delays in transmission, delivery or execution of order due to breakdown or failure of transmission or communication facilities, or to any other cause beyond GoldSilver's control or anticipation. You acknowledge that pricing or typographical errors may occur and that therefore, in the event that a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to an error in pricing or product information, GoldSilver reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any orders placed for said products. Furthermore, GoldSilver reserves the right to deny any internet trade's confirmation due to market volatility and/ or unusual circumstances or conditions. This includes, without limitation, unexpected unavailability of products. <hr><strong>D.</strong>	Export Compliance. Every product that GoldSilver sells is subject to all U.S export laws. No products may be exported to a national or resident of any country to which the U.S has embargoed goods. Additionally, no products may be exported to anyone on the U.S Department of the Treasuary's Office of Foreign Asset Control's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security's Table of Denial Orders. <hr><strong>E.</strong> Death. In the event of your death, GoldSilver will require full documentation of your property interest retained by GoldSilver and proof of death. Proof of death must be an official government document issued by the proper legal authority. Upon confirmation of your death, GoldSilver will freeze your account and to the extent required by law, GoldSilver will act in accordance with the conditions set out in your will, or as instructed by the trustee of your estate. GoldSilver shall be entitled to collect reasonable fees to provide this service. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that such documentation will be provided for in the event of your death. <hr><strong>F.</strong>	Customer Responsibility For Taxes. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for all taxes that may be incurred as a result of a purchase from or sale to us. GoldSilver will only collect taxes on transactions to the extent explicitly required by law. It is your responsibility to be aware of and properly address any taxes to which you may be subject by the state and/ or federal governments. If you have any questions about taxes, you should consult a tax professional about your unique circumstances. GoldSilver does not represent to provide advice or recommendations about your specific taxes and any statements made by us are only for the purpose of raising issues for you to discuss with your tax professional. At no time should any tax information provided by GoldSilver constitute legal advice nor should any information be used or relied upon by you to avoid taxes or penalties. </p><h5>6.	MARKET LOSS POLICY</h5><p> Upon securing a purchase price for the precious metal(s) to be shipped, your order is deemed binding and cannot be canceled. Upon securing a sale price for your metals to GoldSilver, your offer to sell your metals to GoldSilver shall be deemed accepted and both parties shall be bound to the agreement. However, should you fail to meet your obligation whether purchasing from or selling to GoldSilver, we may redeem the precious metals at the current market price. You shall be responsible for any losses suffered by GoldSilver, all additional charges arising as a result of the redemption, and a single Redemption Fee of two hundred United States dollars ($200.00 USD) per transaction. Without limiting any other rights and remedies available to GoldSilver, you authorize GoldSilver to deduct any losses, additional costs and/or the Redemption Fee from your account, or, if you do not have a positive balance in your account, you agree to make this payment to GoldSilver immediately upon receipt of an invoice or other written notice from GoldSilver. Any market gains at the time of redemption shall remain the sole property of GoldSilver. Because all GoldSilver products are priced with respect to the spot price of the metals, this policy applies to all GoldSilver products. </p><h5>7.	STORING PRECIOUS METALS</h5> You are solely responsible for the storage of your metals. We recommend you exercise caution and discretion when deciding on your method of storage. GoldSilver assumes no responsibility after good delivery of product(s) for any consequence resulting from storing your metals whether home delivered, with any IRA custodian / facility, or through the use of direct professional storage services listed on our website. At your request, GoldSilver can provide Master/ Sub-account storage and/ or private storage options for your precious metals with depositories selected by GoldSilver. Storage options through us are only available for bullion products sold by us. In the event you choose to store your metals with us in a Master/ Sub-account, you must first read and agree to the terms and conditions set forth in the specific Third Party Storage Agreement. GoldSilver may have a fee arrangement with the storage facility through which we may receive compensation. In the event GoldSilver needs to change depositories for its Master/Sub-Accounts, you will be notified of the new depository location within 30 calendar days. In the event that you are delinquent on your storage accounts, i.e. storage fees have not been paid up to date, GoldSilver will notify you of your obligation to pay for storage. Where an account is at least 90 days past due, that account may be canceled at the sole discretion of GoldSilver, and we are entitled to liquidate metals as necessary to cover the amount owed by you pursuant to our Vault Storage Agreement, incorporated here by reference. <h5>8.
